# IP Address Tracker Project
### Overview:
I developed an IP Address Tracker application inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge. This project was built using React.js and React Leaflet, leveraging the IP Geolocation API by IPify and the LeafletJS library for interactive maps.

### Key Features:

Real-time IP Location: Displays the user's IP address and location on initial load.

Search Functionality: Allows users to search for any IP address or domain to view key information and its geographic location.

Responsive Design: Ensures optimal layout across various screen sizes.

Interactive Elements: Includes hover states for an enhanced user experience.

### Technologies Used:

React.js: For building the user interface.

React Leaflet: For integrating interactive maps.

IP Geolocation API by IPify: To fetch location data based on IP addresses.

CSS: For responsive and visually appealing design.

This project showcases my ability to integrate APIs and libraries into a functional and aesthetically pleasing web application. You can view the live project and its code on my GitHub and portfolio website.









# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
